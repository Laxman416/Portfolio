### Project 2 - Exploring Test Scores with Pandas:

- DataFrame filtering and sorting (e.g., filtering top-performing schools by SAT scores).
- Groupby and aggregation (e.g., calculating average and standard deviation for boroughs).
- New column creation (e.g., computing total SAT score from math, reading, and writing).
- Identifying insights (e.g., finding schools with top math performance and boroughs with largest SAT score variability).
