{"cells":[{"source":"The Nobel Prize has been among the most prestigious international awards since 1901. Each year, awards are bestowed in chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. In addition to the honor, prestige, and substantial prize money, the recipient also gets a gold medal with an image of Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896), who established the prize.\n\n![](Nobel_Prize.png)\n\nThe Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the outset of the awards from 1901 to 2023. The dataset used in this project is from the Nobel Prize API and is available in the `nobel.csv` file in the `data` folder.\n\nIn this project, you'll get a chance to explore and answer several questions related to this prizewinning data. And we encourage you then to explore further questions that you're interested in!\n\nAnalyze Nobel Prize winner data and identify patterns by answering the following questions:\n\nWhat is the most commonly awarded gender and birth country?\n\nStore your answers as string variables top_gender and top_country.\nWhich decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners in all categories?\n\nStore this as an integer called max_decade_usa.\nWhich decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?\n\nStore this as a dictionary called max_female_dict where the decade is the key and the category is the value. There should only be one key:value pair.\nWho was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?\n\nSave your string answers as first_woman_name and first_woman_category.\nWhich individuals or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years?\n\nStore the full names in a list named repeat_list.\n","metadata":{},"id":"db5bd2ce-918a-4f7d-a927-a3ea74c4b456","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Loading in required libraries and df\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport
